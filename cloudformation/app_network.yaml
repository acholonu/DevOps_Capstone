  Ugochi Jones / Capstone
  This cloud formation template deploys a VPC, with a pair of public and private subnets
  spread across two Availability Zones.  It deploys an Internet Gateway, with a default
  route on the public subnets.  It deploys a pair of NAT Gateways (one in each AZ), and 
  default routes for them in the private subnets.

Parameters:
  EnvironmentName:
    Description: An environment name that will be prefixed to resource names
    Type: String
  
  VpcCIDR:
    Description: > 
      The IP range (CIDR notation) for this VPC.  So every IP address in this VPC
      will start with the first 16 bits with 10.0.
    Type: String
    Default: 10.0.0.0/16

  PublicSubnet1CIDR:
    Description: >
      Defines the IP ranges that exist in this public subnet (public subnet1). Every IP address in this subnet will
      start with 10.0.0. This public subnet will be in the first Availability Zone.
    Type: String
    Default: 10.0.0.0/24

  PublicSubnet2CIDR:
    Description: >
      Defines the IP ranges that exist in this public subnet (public subnet2). Every IP address in 
      this subnet will start with 10.0.1. This public subnet will be in the second Availability Zone.
    Type: String
    Default: 10.0.1.0/24

  PrivateSubnet1CIDR:
    Description: >
      Defines the IP ranges that exist in this private subnet (private subnet1). Every IP address 
      in this subnet will start with 10.0.2. This public subnet will be in the first Availability Zone.
    Type: String
    Default: 10.0.2.0/24

  PrivateSubnet2CIDR:
    Description: >
      Defines the IP ranges that exist in this private (private subnet2). Every IP address in this 
      subnet will start with 10.0.3. This private subnet will be in the second Availability Zone.
    Type: String
    Default: 10.0.3.0/24

# The purpose of the output section is to create variables connected to the resources
# you created in this cloudformation script.  Then other cloudformation scripts can
# refer to these variables to interact within their scripts.
# This allows you to compartmentalize scripts (Networking, Storage, Servers)
# Outputs are totally OPTIONAL.  But they are helpful if you want to 1) import into
# another stack, 2) return in a response, 3) view in the AWS console.
# These are GLOBAL VARIABLES!!!!  So they need to be unique throughout the account.
