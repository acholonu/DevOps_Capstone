# Overview

Sample application with basic interactions.

## Notes to Self

Currently the default name is app.py.  If you wanted to name the app something else, then you set the environment variable `FLASK_APP`.  So:

```bash
    # you are setting the path to the flask app
    export FLASK_APP="./sample_app.py" 
```
